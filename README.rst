narwal
======

narwal (sic) is a Python wrapper for reddit's API made to be simple, intuitive,
and concise, i.e. *pythonic*. ::

    >>> import narwal
    >>> session = narwal.connect('narwal_bot', 'hunter2', user_agent="i'm a narw(h)al!")
    >>> frontpage = session.hot()
    >>> for link in frontpage[:3]:
        ...   print link
        ... 
        (3088) Words can not describe how much I love this pic of Obama and Clinton
        (1697) Rough day for a mom at the airport.
        (1370) I felt awful when this happened.
    >>> frontpage[1].upvote()
    <Response [200]>
    >>> frontpage[1].comment('cool story bro')
    <Comment [narwal_bot: cool story bro]>

See the docs at http://narwal.readthedocs.org/.

Works with Python 2.7.

Read the first message: ::

    >>> print inbox[0]

Get the sender's account info and submissions: ::

    >>> user = session.user(inbox[0].author)

Plus a whole lot more, since most of the reddit API has been implemented.  See
the API docs (or the source) for more features.
